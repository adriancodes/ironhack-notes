# Threads
* What is a thread?
  * is the smallest sequence of programmed instructions that can be
    managed independently by a scheduler
  * thread is a subset of a process
  * a single process can have multiple threads
  * A single thread is processing of one command at a time.
  * Multi threaded means multitasking, faster execution,
    parallelization, responsiveness, better system utilization

* JavaScript is single threaded
  * Under the covers there is a thread pool
  * Only a single thread is handling the event loop
  * Most events are asynchronous
  * When a new event occurs it gets added to the Event loop
  * This loop checks the queue and processes the event one at a time

* Callbacks
  * also known as high order functions
  * we pass them around like variables
  * and use them as arguments to functions
  * not executed immediately - It's "called back"
