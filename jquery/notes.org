 # DOM Notes

* What is the DOM?
  * a programming interface for HTML, XML and SVG documents. It
    provides a structured representation of the document as a tree.
  * provides a representation of the document as a structured group of
    nodes and objects
  * it is not a part of the JavaScript language. It can also be
    accessed by other languages.
  * a web page is a document which can be rendered on the browser or
    as HTML Source
  * provides way to represent, store, and manipulate the document.
  * fully object-oriented representation of the web page.

* Illustrate parent child relationships on the whiteboard

* What is jQuery?
  * JavaScript library that makes DOM traversal, manipulation, event
    handeling, animation and AJAX calls simple.
  * jQuery can be found on over 75% of websites
  * Cross browser compatability and normalization
  * jQuery UI & jQuery Mobile are additional libraries

* jQuery Performance for Selectors

// Slower (the zero-based :even selector is a jQuery extension)
$( "#my-table tr:even" );
 
// Better, though not exactly equivalent
$( "#my-table tr:nth-child(odd)" );

# Avoid Excessive Specificity
$( ".data table.attendees td.gonzalez" );
 
// Better: Drop the middle if possible.
$( ".data td.gonzalez" );

# ID Based Selector
// Fast:
$( "#container div.robotarm" );
 
// Super-fast:
$( "#container" ).find( "div.robotarm" );

# Be specific on the right and less specific on the left
// Unoptimized:
$( "div.data .gonzalez" );
 
// Optimized:
$( ".data td.gonzalez" );

$( ".buttons > *" ); // Extremely expensive.
$( ".buttons" ).children(); // Much better.
 
$( ":radio" ); // Implied universal selection.
$( "*:radio" ); // Same thing, explicit now.
$( "input:radio" ); // Much better.




# <script src="my.js" type="text/javascript" defer="defer"></script>
* scripts below at the bottom of the page
 * defer tells the browser to download scripts after HTML has been
   downloaded
